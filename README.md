# Bamazon
Week of 12 HW: 

Node.js &amp; MySQL  Overview  In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Prompt npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage. Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file. 
If you haven't written a markdown file yet, click here for a rundown, or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions. 


Instructions  Challenge #1: Customer View (Minimum Requirement)  Create a MySQL Database called Bamazon. Then create a Table inside of that database called products. The products table should have each of the following columns: item_id (unique id for each product) product_name (Name of product) department_name price (cost to customer) stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores) Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
